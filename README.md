# Sales Representative Net Promoter Score Analysis

## Project Summary

The Sales Representative Net Promoter Score Analysis project aims to identify the key drivers of a high Net Promoter Score (NPS) among college-educated employees in the software product group. The goal is to create a classification model that can effectively predict whether a sales representative will receive an NPS score of 9 or higher. The analysis explores the impact of various factors such as demographics, qualifications, salary, feedback, and certifications on NPS scores. The findings provide insights to help businesses optimize customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Project Findings

The analysis reveals several key findings:

- Personality traits, specifically "diplomat" and "explorer," have a higher likelihood of achieving an NPS score greater than 9, while "analyst" and "sentinel" personality types have a lower chance.
- Experienced sales representatives tend to have higher NPS scores compared to entry-level and mid-level counterparts.
- Sales representatives with higher salaries and more certifications have higher NPS scores, indicating the importance of experience, expertise, and motivation.
- Feedback plays a significant role, with sales representatives receiving excellent positive feedback having a higher chance of achieving NPS scores greater than 9.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made to improve NPS scores among technical sales representatives:

1. Identify and recruit sales representatives with personality traits that align with different sales roles, giving preference to those with "diplomat" and "explorer" traits.
2. Offer competitive salaries to sales representatives to keep them motivated and improve job satisfaction and motivation, leading to higher NPS scores.
3. Invest in the training and development of sales representatives, particularly in improving their skills and knowledge to enhance their performance.
4. Prioritize representatives with excellent positive feedback, as they are more likely to achieve NPS scores greater than 9.
5. Encourage sales representatives to obtain certifications, as it increases their credibility and perceived expertise, resulting in higher customer trust and loyalty.

Implementing these recommendations can lead to higher NPS scores, ultimately improving customer satisfaction, increasing sales, and driving overall business success.
